# Parameterization Tool for OSSDBS Simulations

This directory contains a tool for parametrically studying OSSDBS (Open-Source Simulated Deep Brain Stimulation) simulations using the `best_electrode_ever.py` electrode.

## Installation

Currently, we are experiencing issues with the installation process. Therefore, to run the tool, please follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to this paramaterization directory
3. Copy the script from `./script` you want to run into this directory.

Alternatively for Step 3, you can also run the tool within iphython using the `%run` magic command (e.g. `%run scripts/mycript.py`) which seems to ... magically work.

Please note that we are actively working on resolving the installation issues and will provide an updated installation guide as soon as possible.
